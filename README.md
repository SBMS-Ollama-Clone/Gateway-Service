### Getting Started
1. To build and run sample applications you need to have Maven, JDK22 and Docker. However, the simplest way to start with it is through any IDE like Intellij or Eclipse.
2. First, you have to run require utility services on Docker container, go to `DevOps-Deployment` folder and run the following command:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```
3. Then you can compile your application with Maven `mvn clean install package` command.
4. Or you can run directly from your IDE by running the `GatewayServiceApplication.java` file.
